FEATURES ðŸŽ¨

The Color Palette is an interactive tool that allows users to upload any image and generate a color palette from the colors present in the image. The tool includes a file upload option where users can select their image. Below the upload option, there is a toggle bar that lets users choose the number of colors they want to be displayed in the generated palette. Once the palette is displayed, it shows the unique color codes (e.g., HEX values) for each color in the palette. Additionally, the tool provides suggested applications for the palette, helping users understand how they can use the colors effectively in their projects. This feature-rich interface makes it easy to extract and utilize color palettes from any image, enhancing creative workflows.
